There was a fair amount of provided code for this project.  The largest part of
this first checkpoint is to understand the provided code and put together a
plan and design your final solution.

Your program segmentation faults when run on the OppLab machines and my 
office machine.  This is most likely due to the Nvidia openGL libraries which
have a bug that is triggered by strings.  Link with the pthread library 
(i.e. add -lpthread to the LIBS macro) to workaround this problem.  I mentioned
this in class after the project was assigned.

* Pass One - Assign labels 
* Pass Two - Label Blobs
- Labeling blobs needs to be an efficient operation
* Pseudocolor blobs
* Display pseudocolor blobs
- Perform size filtering
* Pseudocolor filtered blobs
* Display size filtered, pseudocolored blobs
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm seeing a couple problems.  First, you're showing two size filtered images
and no unfiltered pseudocolored image.  Second, your connected component code
is missing some pixels in the first row causing a mismatch when I test against
the reference implementation.
