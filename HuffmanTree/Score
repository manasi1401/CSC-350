You know, if you call your makefile 'makefile' or 'Makefile' then you don't
have to specify it on the make line, right?

% make

vs

% make -f makeFile.mk


The histogram needs to be written to the output (compressed) file in binary.
Right now you're just printing it to the output file.  After you generate
the histogram (which you appear to be doing) you need to write the 256
element array/vector to the beginning of the compressed file.  You'll need
this when you're going to uncompress the file.  After this checkpoint, what
I expect is the output file will be 1024 bytes in length and contain 256
integers which represent the frequency of each of the 256 bytes found in the
input file.

In addition, when running your executable with the -d command line option I
would expect your code to read that 1024 byte histogram in from the compressed
file so that you can create the huffman tree.  You're not writing out the
histogram to the output file so the -d option is also not yet working.

Checkpoint #2 requires that you create the histogram and build a huffman code
tree.  You will need to write (not print) the histogram to the output file.
You will also need to read that histogram from the compressed file and create
the huffman code tree.  The checkpoints are meant to keep you on track for
the final delivery.  If you have questions, ask them during class or drop
by the office to get them answered.

-------------------------------- Checkpoint # 2 -------------------------------
- All elements from Checkpoint #1
- Huffman tree is built correctly
- Decoder and Encoder writes binary file
- Decoder reads binary file

When bringing over the commit hash c7e14c161d3718, compiling and running I
get:

% git checkout c7e14c161d3718
% make -f makefile.mk
% huffman -e input out

A 5
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::out_of_range'
  what():  basic_string::erase
Aborted (core dumped)

The failure is coming from HuffmanBinaryTree::traverse.

The HuffmanBinaryTree class is nicely structured, the rest of the code is a
bit of a mess (e.g. main.cpp).  There is some refactoring to do before
submission and chasing down this bug.  I see there are commits after the
one I tested so perhaps this problem has been addressed.
