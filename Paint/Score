* Code Compiles
* Code runs and brings up a window
* At least some of the palette is being drawn
* The palette behaves correctly when the window is resized
- All team members show repository activity
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Looking good so far.  There is some imbalance between the team members
(1 vs 6 commits) in terms of repo activity.  This can be caused by a number
of things:

* You're doing paired programming under a single team member's account
* Some team members do more frequent commits than the others
* Some team members aren't pulling their weight

If it's the first one, make sure and put something in the commit message that
indicates work is being done while paired programming.  Example:

   Created callbacks.cpp and callbacks.h [paired]

If it's the second one, check to see you're doing frequent commits but not
committing every time a single line of code gets changed.

If it's the third one, then work at scheduling time to work on the project so
you're not putting all the burden on other team members.

It could also be that one of the team members is an 'gunner' who grabs projects
and runs with them in the exclusion of all else leaving little for other team
members to do.  We would like to also avoid this.

Not a problem (yet).  Keep an eye on it.
-----Checkpoint # 2------------------------------------------------------------
- Checkpoint One Requirements (does not compile, missing mouse.h)
* Full Palette Displayed
  Function Headers
* Select Border Color
* Select Fill Color
- Can draw at least one shape
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After the latest push I see the code compiles with some warnings.

I can get a rectangle to draw but it looks like there is something amiss with
the coordinates.  Remember that openGL numbers the Y-axis with increasing 
Y-values as you move down the window.  Make sure that you are taking that
into account when creating the coordinate and offsets for your shapes.

Your output statements indicate that you are correctly detecting when colors
in your palette are chosen.  I don't see an indication on the palette or
tool area as to which color was chosen.

The repository activity is much more balanced then during Checkpoint #1

Good job adding author information to functions, it helps me see who is working
on what part of the code.

Keep working to get the requirements met.  There won't be a weekly assignment
next week to give the teams a chance to concentrate on the project.  Once you
have things working, consider going through and refactoring the code to make
it more readable, maintainable, modular, etc.
