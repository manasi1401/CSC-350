A simple OpenGL example that will display some simple graphics in a window.  It
will also capture keyboard and mouse events.
<p>
This is example code only, in an actual application that uses the OpenGL and
glut libraries you would not place code that does work in the callback 
functions.
<p>
<b>Build</b>
<pre>
make

<b>Run</b>
<pre>
main
</pre>
In the window mouse events are captured and displayed to the console.  Keyboard
events are also captured and displayed.  Exit the application using the &lt;esc&gt; key or the 'X' in the upper-right corner.
